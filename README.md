# Apna College DSA Coursework

This repository is my personal coding companion as I journey through the Data Structures and Algorithms course by Apna College. It's a growing archive of my hands-on practice with Java, tackling the foundational building blocks of computer science.

## What's Inside

Structured around the course curriculum, you'll find directories corresponding to key DSA topics, each filled with Java code examples, my solutions to exercises, and notes that crystalize complex concepts.

## How to Navigate

Dive into each topic's directory to see my progression and approaches to problem-solving. The repository will be updated regularly with new content, mirroring my academic progress.

## Collaboration

Feel free to use these resources as a learning aid. Discussions and pull requests are welcome if you'd like to suggest improvements or alternative solutions.

Happy coding and learning!
