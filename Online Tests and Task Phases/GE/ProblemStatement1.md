# 248 Numbers Problem

## Problem Statement

A number is said to be a **"248 number"** if the count of `2`s is equal to the count of `4`s and the count of `4`s is equal to the count of `8`s in that number. Additionally, the count of `2`s should be at least 1.

Given a number `N`, your task is to find the count of "248 numbers" in the interval `[1, N]`. Since the answer can be very large, you need to return the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Input Format

- A single integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^10).

### Output Format

- Print the count of "248 numbers" in the interval `[1, N]` modulo `1000000007`.

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^10`

### Example

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
300
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
There are 2 numbers less than or equal to 300 that have `2`, `4`, and `8` in their digits:
- The two numbers are `248` and `284`. Both have equal `2`s, `4`s, and `8`s, i.e., 1 of each.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
10
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
There are no numbers less than or equal to 10 that meet the "248 number" criteria.

## Solution Approach

### Dynamic Programming (Digit DP)

Given the constraints (with `N` up to `10^10`), a brute-force approach iterating through each number would be inefficient. Instead, we use **Digit Dynamic Programming (Digit DP)**.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is used to avoid recalculating results for overlapping subproblems.
- We represent each number as a string of digits and count valid "248 numbers" by iterating digit by digit.
- **Memoization** is employed to store intermediate results, preventing redundant calculations.
- **Modular Arithmetic** is used to handle the large numbers, ensuring that results stay within bounds.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Digit Array**:
   - Convert the number `N` into a character array of digits.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Implement a recursive function `count(pos, count2, count4, count8, tight)`:
     - `pos`: Current digit position.
     - `count2`: Count of digit `2` so far.
     - `count4`: Count of digit `4` so far.
     - `count8`: Count of digit `8` so far.
     - `tight`: Boolean to ensure we do not exceed the original number `N`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When we reach the end of the digit array, check if the counts of `2`, `4`, and `8` are equal and whether the count of `2`s is greater than 0.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use a DP table to store the results of already computed subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The function will return the total count of "248 numbers" for the given number `N`, which is printed as the output.

## Implementation

The code implementation for this problem is in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    static long[][][][] dp;
    static char[] digits;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long N = sc.nextLong();  // Reading the input number N
        sc.close();

        digits = Long.toString(N).toCharArray();  // Convert N to a character array
        int length = digits.length;
        dp = new long[length][length][length][2];  // DP memoization array

        // Initialize DP array with -1 to signify uncomputed states
        for (long[][][] array : dp) {
            for (long[][] innerArray : array) {
                for (long[] innerInnerArray : innerArray) {
                    Arrays.fill(innerInnerArray, -1);
                }
            }
        }

        long result = count(0, 0, 0, 0, true);  // Start counting from the first digit
        System.out.println(result);  // Output the result
    }

    // Recursive function to count valid "248 numbers"
    static long count(int pos, int count2, int count4, int count8, boolean tight) {
        if (pos == digits.length) {
            // Base case: Check if counts of 2, 4, 8 are equal and count2 > 0
            return (count2 == count4 && count4 == count8 && count2 > 0) ? 1 : 0;
        }

        // If this subproblem has already been computed, return the cached result
        if (dp[count2][count4][count8][tight ? 1 : 0] != -1) {
            return dp[count2][count4][count8][tight ? 1 : 0];
        }

        long limit = tight ? digits[pos] - '0' : 9;  // Determine the upper limit for the current digit
        long res = 0;

        // Iterate over all possible digits (0 to limit)
        for (int d = 0; d <= limit; d++) {
            res = (res + count(pos + 1, count2 + (d == 2 ? 1 : 0), count4 + (d == 4 ? 1 : 0), count8 + (d == 8 ? 1 : 0), tight && d == limit)) % MOD;
        }

        // Store the result in the DP array for future use
        dp[count2][count4][count8][tight ? 1 : 0] = res;
        return res;
    }
}
```
